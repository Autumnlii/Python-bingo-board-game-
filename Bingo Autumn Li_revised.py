""" Summary of the method:
    This code contains 4 methods: bingo_board, one_board, many_board, many_games
    1. bingo_board: check if a square is marked or not;
    2. one_board: simulate 9 times game on one board, return win_times;
    3. many_board: efficient way to generate random baord and marked board;
    4. many_games: generate n boards, for each board plays n*9 games, return
    board as array with max win_times
    
    Test tips: just click runing
    If time is limited, set a small number,for varibale 'num' in line 27
    I assume we can achieve more than 1 times of winning in one gameï¼ˆ9 throws of dice)
